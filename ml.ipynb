        "A Multi-layer Perceptron, also known as a feedforward neural network, forms the basis for most deep learning algorithms. The model essential consists of layers of \"neurons\", where each neuron in layer $l$ is connected to every neuron in layer $l+1$. In the case of our MLP model, we will use 2 hidden layers of size 128 and 64 neurons respectively. Our input layer will have 13 neurons, one for each parameter we pass to the network. Since we are doing a binary classification task, we'll have 2 output neuronsâ€“one for predicting stroke and the other for predicting non-stroke. When we pass the input to the MLP, each neuron will perform a specific set of operations to the values (which we optimize when we train the model) before passing the output to neurons in the next layer. The process propagates through the network until it reaches the output neurons, where we determine which classification is more likely."

        "If you're wondering why MLP models are so common in deep learning, it's because these models allow us to approximate complicated functions as a set of non-linear transformations. Let's take a neuron $x_1$ in layer 1 which is connected to neuron $x_2$ in layer 2. The transition from $x_1$ to $x_2$ is given by: $$x_{1,2} = \\text{ReLU}(w_{1,2} * x_1 + b_{1,2})$$ If $w_{1,2} * x_1 + b_{1,2}$ looks familiar, you're right! It's a linear transformation of $x_1$. We call $w_{1,2}$ the weight between two neurons and $b_{1,2}$ the bias. When we train our model, we are specifically optimizing these values (through [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation)). The magic behind these models are *activation functions* like ReLU. The function is super simple $$ReLU(x) =\n",
