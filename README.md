# TritonHacks 2025 AI/ML Starter Kit Repo

### This AI/ML starter-kit contains 2 parts: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning (ML). In the first part, we will be building Seaborn- & Matplotlib- powered models (e.g. bar graphs, histograms, scatterplots, boxplots) to help visualize and analyze the relationship between different input features and the stroke-prediction outcome. In the ML part of this project, we will build predictive Scikit-Learn models (KNN, Linear Regression, Random Forests/Decision Trees, MLP Classifier). Both parts are powered by Google Colab.

#### Please download the Kaggle dataset (linked below). Then, create a google drive called "AI-ML-StarterKit" and store the .csv file of the downloaded dataset onto the drive folder.
